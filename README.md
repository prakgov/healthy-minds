## Overview
Healthy Minds is a mental health monitoring platform that allows patients to track daily wellbeing indicators and enables healthcare professionals to monitor trends and record treatment notes. The system visualizes behavioral patterns such as mood, sleep, stress, and exercise, and compares them with Finnish population-level health indicators.

The platform is designed as a proof-of-concept health technology system demonstrating how behavioral data and public health statistics can support mental wellbeing monitoring.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:**
	* React
	* Vite
	* TypeScript
	* Tailwind CSS
	* Recharts

* **Backend:**
	* FastAPI
	* SQLAlchemy	
	* Pydantic
	* JWT Authentication

* **Database**
	* PostgreSQL

* **Hosting**
	* Render

## Authentication:

The system uses JWT-based authentication. Protected API routes require a valid Bearer token issued during login.

**User roles:**
* patient
* professional

**Role-based access control ensures:**
* patients cannot access professional dashboards
* professionals cannot access patients outside their assigned list


## Database Structure
- Main database entities:
	* users
	* mood_entries
	* treatment_notes
	* patient_professional_links
	* finnish_health_cache

## Local Development Setup:

1. Clone the repository and open the project root.

2. Configure environment variables:
	- Frontend: copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`
	- Backend: copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`

3. Start the backend (FastAPI):

	```bash
	cd backend
	python -m venv venv
	```

- Activate the virtual environment:
	- Windows (PowerShell): `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
	- macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`

	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	uvicorn app.main:app --reload
	```
- Local development URLs:
	- Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
	- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

4. Start the frontend (Vite + React):

	```bash
	cd frontend
	npm install
	npm run dev
	```

	- Frontend app: http://localhost:5173

5. (Optional) Run tests:

	```bash
	# Backend tests
	cd backend
	pytest

	# Frontend tests
	cd frontend
	npm test
	```
